# Electric-vehicle-Data-Analysis (Interactive Dashboard using Tableau)

## Project Objective
To analyze the adoption and distribution of electric vehicles in the U.S. by evaluating key metrics such as vehicle type (BEV vs. PHEV), electric range, model year trends, manufacturer popularity, geographic spread, and eligibility for clean fuel incentives—using an interactive Tableau dashboard for actionable insights.

## Dataset used
- <a href="https://github.com/Gowra-2001/Electric-vehicle-DataAnalysis/commit/0c0fd0321a1c7d008088bbf3c518e5c753076765">Dataset</a>
## Dashboard
- <a href="https://github.com/Gowra-2001/Electric-vehicle-Data-Analysis/blob/main/Dashboard%20.jpg">Dashboard</a>

## Key KPIs
- Total Vehicles - 150,413.
- Avg Electric Range - 67.83 miles.
- Total BEV Vehicles - 116,745 (77.6%). 
- Total PHEV Vehicles - 33,668 (22.4%).

## Key Conclusions
- Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs) make up the majority (~77%) of total electric vehicles.
- Average electric range of EVs is around 67.8 miles, showing growing efficiency.
- EV adoption has steadily increased since 2011, with strong recent growth.
- Tesla and Nissan are among the top EV manufacturers by total vehicles.
- Washington state leads in EV adoption, highlighting strong regional interest.
-A significant number of vehicles are CAFV-eligible, showing policy impact.
